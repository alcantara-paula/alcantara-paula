## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Paula, a newcomer frontend developer.

My latest project is the app How Long to Watchâ€¦, created after I got tired of manually calculating time and time again by when I would finish a 2000s TV show with 6+ seasons my friends and I decided to watch at that moment. Now things are much easier. You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/alcantara-paula).
