## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paula, a frontend developer making fun and responsive websites.

My latest project is the app How Long to Watchâ€¦, created after I got tired of manually calculating time and time again by when I would finish a 2000s TV show with 6+ seasons my friends and I decided to watch at that moment. Now things are much easier. You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/alcantarapaula/how-long-to-watch).
